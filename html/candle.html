                <p>Almighty and everlasting God,who in the counsel of your infinite wisdom orders all things for our
                    good: Mercifully grant to us your servants a spirit of discernment;that amidst the challenges and
                    changes of this world,we may perceive your will,trust your providence,and walk in the path you have
                    prepared for us;through Jesus Christ our Lord,Amen.</p>

                <p>Heavenly Father,by whose grace we are called to occupations both great and small: Grant us such
                    awareness of your presence in our daily labor,that we may perform every task as an act of worship
                    unto you;and empower us by your spirit,through Jesus Christ our Lord,Amen.</p>
